# Kin Resources

This repository hosts the code for a website about the TTRPG Kin.
It's a simple static site using Zola.

Some functionalities use Javascript.
The Javascript code written is quite messy.
It's mostly a "prototype", and even though it works fine, I would like to rewrite it in a more proper way later.

## Features

	* NPCs sheets : They are mostly tests and not necessarily real usable NPC. However, as I'll start fleshing out NPCs myself, I will probably add them here.
	* NPC Creator : This helps create NPCs online. You can export them to a format usable by this site, or you can print a page as PDF using your browser functions (tested in Firefox).
	* Character sheets : There is none yet, but I'll add them once I'll make some. This should be some useful or inspirational exemples.
	* Character creator : This should help creating characters online, with similar export functionalities as the NPC creator. You can also use the official [fillable PDF](https://victoriacorva.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Kin_TTRPG_CharacterSheet_Fillable.pdf)
	* Miscellaneous : I intend to put here random bits and tips.


[^1] : There are some issues if a trait or proficiency name has spaces. But this can be fixed manually quite easily.
