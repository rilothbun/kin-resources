## Kin

This website is about the tabletop role-playing game *[Kin](https://victoriacorva.xyz/books/kin-the-fantasy-tabletop-role-playing-game/)*, made by [Victoria Corva](https://victoriacorva.xyz).
You can purchase it on [itch.io](https://vicorva.itch.io/kin-the-fantasy-tabletop-role-playing-game).

## Technical stuff

This is a static website, no processing is made server-side, and no user data are stored.
It uses Javascript for a couple of dynamic features (NPC Creator, downloading sheets in various formats...), but otherwise is only plain HTML and CSS.
The source code will be released at some point, allowing you to host this site on your own, with custom NPCs to help build your campaign.

The static site generator is [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).
Thus there are options to download sheets as files directly usable by Zola.
