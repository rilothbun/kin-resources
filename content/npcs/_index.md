You may be looking for the [NPC Creator](@/npcs/npc-creator.md).

To print any of the NPC sheet to PDF, use the "Print page as PDF" function of your browser.
You may need to fiddle in with the options to get the results you want, but you can obtain a decent result.

Here are also a couple of NPCs sheets.

  * [Avenor](@/npcs/avenor.md)
  * [Beaver](@/npcs/beaver.md)
  * [Test NPC](@/npcs/test-npc.md)
