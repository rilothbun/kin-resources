You will need to have Javascript activated to use this page.
This is still a work in progress.
It doesn't look really good, but it works.

To print any of the NPC sheet to PDF, use the "Print page as PDF" function of your browser.
You may need to fiddle in with the options to get the results you want, but you can obtain a decent result.

The "Export to Markdown" button allows to export the NPC you've created to a Markdown page that Zola would understand.
Zola is the site generator used by this project, so it can ease the making of new pages.
One problem is that if you use spaces in a trait or proficiency name, the exported file would not work totally out of the box.
